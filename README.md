# Algorithms

## What is an algorithm?

Algorithm is a collection of **wel-defined instructions** to solve a specific task or problem. The instruction is step-by-step until to solve the specific task.

Think of a recipe of a delicious chocolate cake, it is an algorithm. There are instructions well-defined that if you execute them, you will have made a chocolate cake.

Any task of your daily life can be an algorithm, even the simplest ones. 

Algorithms in programming is similar to a recipe of a cake, it is a collection of code that is designed to solve a specific problem. Algorithms are plain instructions that can be implemented in any language. They use logic and reasoning to solve problems. 

There is a plenty of algorithms already designed, there are algorithms to sort, to search and to solve problems and so on.

Learn these algorithms is a great idea, it will enhance your analytical skills and your solve-problems ability.

## Advantages of learning algorithms
- Well-designed
- Solve problem accurately

# Types of Algorithms
1. Sorting Algorithm
2. Search Algorithm 
3. Graph Algorithm
4. Machine Learning
5. Dynamic Programming 
6. Recursive Algorithm
7. Genetic Algorithm
...and so on


It's quite impossible to say how many algorithms is available, we also can create our own algorithms, or customize the ones built-in.

Let's Start!!
